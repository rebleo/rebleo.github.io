			<p>Suppose you didnt know what a door is. That it opens, for instance. It would seema  different part part of the wall, thinner, more resonant. Adecorative rectangle set in the wall, an embodiment of some geometrical mystery like the Golden Section. It would seem tantalizing to someone trapped in the room -- a perverse, mean tease: the wall is thin here, soft, but still unpassable. How little it would take to get through the wall, yet you cant.</p>

			<p>Suppose you didnt know what a door is, that it can open, that its resistance defines the zone of least resistance, bu thtat zone requires a deft use of something learned, a knack, a skill: twisting hte knob and pulling. Or pushing. Even if you got as far as turning and pulling, if the door were teh kidn that opened outward, you'd still never guess, never get through.</p>

   <p>Suppose all round us there things like doors in things like walls and we never knew. </p>
