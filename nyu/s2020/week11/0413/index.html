  <h3>Voice and Address</h3>
		<p>You are the owner of one complete thought</p>
  <p>Its sons and daughters<br>
  march toward the capital</p>
  <p>There are growing apprehensions to the south</p>
  <p> It is ringed about <br>
   by enclaves of those who have escaped</p>
  <p>You would like to live somewhere else</p>
  <p>away from the exaggerated music   <br>
   in a new, exaggerated shirt</p>
  <p>a place where colored stones have no value</p>
  <p> this hill is temporary <br>
  but convenient for lunch</p>
  <p> Does she mean that the afternoon should pass</p>   
  <p>in such a manner <br>
    not exactly rapidly</p>
 <p>and with a studied inattention</p>
 <p>He has lost his new car<br>
  of which you were, once,</p>
 <p>a willing prisoner</p>
 <p>  a blister in your palm<br>
  identical with the skyâ€™s bowl</p>
 <p>reflected in the empty sentence</p>
 <p> whose glare we have completely shed<br>
  ignoring its freshness</p>
 <p> The message has been sent</p>
 <p>across the lesser features in the glass<br>
  where the listeners are expendable</p>
 <p>The heart is thus flexible</p>
 <p>now straight now slightly bent</br>
  and yesterday was the day for watching it</p>
 <p>  from the shadow of its curious house</p>
 <p>   Your photo has appeared<br>
  an island of calm</p>
 <p>  in a sea of priapic doubt</p>
 <p>  You are the keeper of one secret thought<br>
  the rose and its thorn no longer stand for</p>
 <p>You would like to live somewhere</p>
 <p> but this is not permitted<br>
  You may not even think of it</p>
 <p>lest the thinking appear as words</p>
 <p> and the words as things<br>
  arriving in competing waves</p>
 <p>from the ruins of that place</p>
