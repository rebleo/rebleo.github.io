  <h3>A Blessing in Disguise</h3>
    <p>Yes, they are alive and can have those colors,<br>
    But I, in my soul, am alive too. <br>
  I feel I must sing and dance, to tell<br>
Of this in a way, that knowing you may be drawn to me.</p>


  <p>And I sing amid despair and isolation <br>
  Of the chance to know you, to sing of me <br>
Which are you. You see, <br>
You hold me up to the light in a way </p>
  <p> I should never expected, or suspected, perhaps<br>
   Because you always tell me I am you, <br>
   And right. The great spruces loom. <br>
  I am yours to die with, to desire</p>

  <p>I cannot ever think of me, I desire you <br>
  For a room in which the chairs ever <br>
Have their backs turned to the light <br>
Inflicted on the stone and paths, the real trees</p>

  <p>That seem to shine at me thorugh a lattice toward you. <br>
  If the wild light of this January day is true <br>
I pledge me to be truthful unto you <br>
Whom I cannot ever stop remembering</p>

  <p> Remembering to forgive. Remember to pass beyond you into  <br>
     <span>the day</span>   <br>
On the wings of the secret you will never know. <br>
Taking me from myself, in the path <br>
Which the pastel girth of the day has assigned to me. </p>   
 
 <p>I prefer "you" in the plural, I want "you," <br>
You must coemt to me,all golden and pale  <br>
Like the dew and the air. <br>
And then I start getting this feeling of exaltation.</p>
